// 1. Create a string that contains your favorite word. It can be in any language!

// 2. Now let's make all the characters uppercase in the following string: "hey! can you hear me?"

// 3. Next, make every character lowercase in the following sentence: "SHHHHH - We're in the Library!!!"

// 4. Find a method that can tell you how many characters are in the following string: "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

// 5. Capitalize the first letter of the first, middle, and last names of: "stephen william hawking"

// 6. Change the period in this sentence to an exclamation point: "I just won the powerball jackpot."

// 7. Create three variables `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` to hold the following strings: `"zip"`, `"zap"`, and `"zop"`. Then, add together the three strings, once with **string interpolation** and once with **string concatenation**.

// 8. There is a typing error in the following string. Use a method to remove the extra character: "Programming is so mulch fun!"
